## A Note on Assessment Philosophy

Welcome. The assessments in this course are designed not merely to test your knowledge, but to serve as cornerstones of your learning process. Each project is a carefully structured challenge that requires you to synthesize the theoretical concepts we discuss with practical, hands-on implementation. The goal is to cultivate not just competence, but true expertise and intuition in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. You will be building, testing, and iterating. You will encounter failures. This is expected. True understanding in robotics is forged in the crucible of debugging a system where software, hardware, and the physical world intersect.
